## Tech Considerations

### Vue
I choose Vue 3 over Vue 2 because is the future major version. The disadvantages of work now with this version are that tools and common packages have been not updated yet to works properly. Tools like Vue Devtools for Chrome, Vuelidate and the next versions of VueRouter and Vuex.

The composition API looks promising, but most of the docs are still using the Options API.

### Responsive design
I made the client responsive because on the world of today most of the web traffic comes from mobile devices.

### Styles
I choose Bootstrap like CSS framework because still is the most popular and most sites used it. Easy to use and find documentation. A great added will be purgeCSS to remove unused CSS, because you never use all styles provided by a CSS framework.

Another option considered was Tailwind, which has a different approach based on utilities instead of components.

### TypeScript
I like TypeScript because avoid many common errors. I didn't use for these project to keep the code simple.

### JWT
I found this way to authenticate users very easy and portable, and also mobile friendly instead of cookies.

### D3 for chart creation
If app uses many different types of charts, a package that contains many chart components could be a better solution. I use this because is more customizable.

### SQLite
A portable database, useful for development purposes that don't require any installation.
